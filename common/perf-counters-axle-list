#r4F5B 5BH 4FH Cycles stalled due to out of order resources full. (ROB?)
#r0487 87H 04H Stall cycles due to IQ is full. Cycles with no instr. issue
#r02A2 A2H 02H Counts the cycles of stall due to lack of load buffers.
#r04A2 A2H 04H Cycles stalled due to no eligible RS entry available.
#r08A2 A2H 08H Cycles stalled due to no store buffers available.
#r10A2 A2H 10H Cycles stalled due to re-order buffer full.
#r20A2 A2H 20H Cycles stalled due to writing the FPU control word.
